# COMICKA

Comicka is a platform for webcomic readers and creators. Users may upload their comics to share with the world, and anyone is free to browse the site and discover new creations.

## Implementation

Comicka is built on a Ruby-on-Rails backend and PostgreSQL database. Its frontend is made in React.js and supported by Flux application architecture.

#### Authentication

Some things happen in the backend, and then they go to the frontend. It's kinda dope. Try it out as the demo user, Minna. Or make your own account! We use coolio encryption and session tokens to make sure that everything's perfectly safe.

#### Comics

We have models and models that belong to models. They are rendered in components that are in other components. Sometimes the components are modals, in which case we render models of modals in modal model components.

#### Uploading and Editing

You can edit things and add things if you have sufficient privilege: you must me logged in to upload comics, and you must own a comic to edit it. As Minna, though, you can mess around with Stand Still Stay Silent.

## Future

It's gonna be awesome. We need a lot of key features still, though.

#### Bookshelves

People can store comics on their shelves. We'll also bookmark readers' progress through each comic, and let them know when comics are updated.

#### Comments

What's a webcomic site without comments? Trash, I tell you. Absolute trash.

#### Profiles

Creators especially need profiles to display the wonderful webcomics they've worked on.
